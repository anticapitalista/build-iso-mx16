  • [Up Arrow] -- highlight previous link  • [Down Arrow] -- highlight next link  • [Left Arrow], [Backspace] -- return to previous page  • [Right Arrow], [Enter, [Space] -- follow link  • [Page Up], [Home] -- go to first link on page  • [Page Down], [End] -- go to last link on page  • [Esc] -- leave help
Tip: use [Left Arrow] or [Backspace] to go back to your place (same highlighted link) on the previous page.
Go to general-helpGeneral Help
Return to the mainMain Menugeneral-helpGeneral HelpThis bootloader lets you select what to boot: antiX Linux, hard drive boot, or memtest. In the case of antiX Linux you can select which boot parameters (cheat codes) get set. There are three ways to enter information:
  • Main Menu
 [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] select which program to run and some boot options. [Enter] starts the boot process.
  • Boot Options
 [Left Arrow], [Right Arrow], and [Backspace] edit some main menu options directly. You can also type in new options.
  • Function Key Pop-up Menus
 [F2] through [F8] open menus. Navigate them with the arrow keys. [Enter] selects highlighted option. [Esc] leaves the pop-up menu without selecting an entry.
Tip: press [F12] to see all the currently selected boot options.
Go to helpUsing the Help System
 Return to the mainMain MenulanguageF2: Select LanguagePress [F2] to get a list of supported languages. Select your language. In addition to setting the language, this option will also set the keyboard layout and timezone. If your country has more than one timezone then use the F3 Timezone menu to explicitly set the timezone for your area.
This menu is an easy shortcut for entering lang=[language-code] directly on the boot options line.
The default language is American English.
Return to the mainMain MenutimezoneF3: Select TimezonePress [F3] to get a list of cities in various time zones. The cities are listed in time zone order so they circle the globe eastward. If your area uses Daylight Savings Time then make sure you select a city that does also. These cities are marked with a trailing * (asterisk). Your system will be started using the timezone selected.
 The menu is an easy shortcut for entering tz=[your-timezone] directly on the boot line. 
The default time zone is Eastern Time (EST or EDT depending on the time of year).
Tip: you do not have to use this menu if you have set a language and your country/area has only one time-zone.
Return to the mainMain MenuoptionsF4: Miscellaneous OptionsYou can only select one of these options. If you want more than one then you will need to type some of them in manually. Normally checkfs, savestate, and nosavestate are only useful on the LiveUSB or a frugal install.
checkmd5 ............ Check integrity of the install media.
checkfs .............. Check integrity of the LivUSB and persistent file systems.
toram .................. Copy the compressed file system to RAM. 
from=usb ............ Sets default booting device to a LiveUSB
nousb2 ................ Disable all usb-2 devices. This helps a few older systems boot.
acpi=off ............. Disable acpi. This helps on some older laptops.
hwclock=ask ..... Have the system help determine the clock setting
hwclock=utc ...... Use UTC for hardware clock (Linux-only systems)
hwclock=local .. Use localtime for hardware clock (Windows systems)
private .............. Change default root and demo passwords before booting for increased security
nostore ......... Disable LiveUSB-Storage feature.
bootchart .......... Create /var/log/bootchart.tgz
savestate .......... Save some files across reboots eg alsa sound, networking (LiveUSB only)
nosavestate ...... Don't save files across reboots (LiveUSB only)

See mountingMounting Options for the rest of the F4 menu options.
 See option-detailsOption Details for details on some of these options.
 Return to the mainMain Menuoption-detailsF4: Option DetailsCheck File Systems (checkfs)
 Check all ext2/3/4 file systems used by the LiveUSB/frugal-install and by persistence. Will not check a LiveCD or a LiveUSB made with a fat32 file system. 

To Ram (toram)
 Copy the linuxfs file to RAM. This takes some time during the boot but it will make LiveCDs and USB-1.0 LiveUSBs run much faster after the boot is complete. 

Hardware Clock (hwclock=[utc|local])
 The hardware clock saves the time and date between boots. If you are dual booting with Windows then use local, otherwise utc is best. 

Saving State (savestate, nosavestate)
 These options should only appear on a LiveUSB/frugal-install. Even if persistence is not enabled we will save some files for you across reboots which can be handy. See the directory /antiX/state/ on the LiveUSB which will be created on the first boot.
Back to optionsMiscellaneous Options
 Return to mainMain MenumountingF4: Mounting OptionsThe Live system will dynamically update the fstab file whenever a usb drive gets plugged in. You can also choose to have drives mounted automatically when they are plugged in.
  • automount -- mount drives when they are plugged in  • mount=usb -- in addition, mount all usb drives at boot time  • mount=all -- in addition, mount ALL devices at boot time  • mount=off -- disable all extra mounting
Note: Your automount choices are saved on persistent systems.
See optionsMiscellaneous Options for the rest of the F4 menu options.
Return to mainMain MenupersistF5: Persistence Optionsoff ......... No Persistence/No frugal
persist_all ..... Fast. Saves root and home (uses RAM, saves at shutdown)
persist_root .... Fast. Only saves root (uses RAM, saves at shutdown)
persist_static .. Slow. Saves root and home (no RAM use, saves constantly)
persist_home .... Only home persistence
frugal_persist .. Frugal with both root and home persistence
frugal_root ..... Frugal with only root persistence
frugal_static ... Frugal with home and static root persistence
frugal_home ..... Frugal with only home persistence
frugal_only ..... Only Frugal, no persistence

See persist-detailsPersist Details for details on some of these options.
 Return to the mainMain Menupersist-detailsF5: Persist Details  • Frugal
 Copy files from the install media (LiveCD/USB) to an internal hard drive partition and finish booting from that. Think of this as a to-disk analogy of toram boot parameter.
  • Root Persist
 Save all the changes to the file-system in RAM and then transfer these changes to disk right before you shutdown or reboot. Fast, but space is limited by how much RAM you have.
  • Static Root
 Saves all your file-system changes directly to a file. This can be slow but it requires no extra RAM and no changes need to be transfered when you shutdown.
  • Home Persist
 Only save changes to files and directories under /home. This will include all of your bookmarks and personal settings. Changes are stored immediately and speed is almost never an issue.
Return to the mainMain MenudesktopF6: Select Desktop ProgramOn full and base systems, there are a number of desktop programs (window managers) available. The F6 menu allows you to choose which desktop program to use.
Desktop names that start with Rox- (Rox pinboard) or Space- (SpaceFM desktop) provide desktop icons, convenient for people who are just starting out. The min- prefix, however, boots the selected window manager with the least amount of additional bells and whistles.
If you are running a persistent system and you install new window manager programs then you can boot into them by typing desktop=program-name. Look in the /usr/share/xsessions/ directory to see what names should be used.
New for antiX: The F6 menu also provides Dark theme and Light theme options. Since light is the default, use Dark theme to change the color scheme of all the desktop programs (Fluxbox, IceWM, etc). There is also the option to set the font-size.
Return to the mainMain MenuconsoleF7: Set Console ResolutionThis menu allows you to set the resolution of the virtual consoles using the deprecated vga kernel boot parameter. This works well on many older systems but on newer systems with wide screen displays the codes used are non-standard. For example the 1600x1200* resolution works in Virtual Box but may not work elsewhere.
Most newer systems support Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) which lets the video driver handle the consoles and automatically sets the highest resolution possible.
  • vga=788 800×600  • vga=791 1024×768  • vga=794 1280×1024  • vga=895 1366x768  • vga=980 1600×900  • vga=842 1600×1200  • vga=839 1600×1200*  • vga=ask ask
Return to the mainMain MenufrugalFrugal InstallReturn to the mainMain MenusaveF8: Save Bootloader SettingsOn LiveUSBs and Frugal installs, the F8 Save menu should appear. A LiveUSB made with the "dd" command acts like a LiveCD and does not have the F8 Save menu.
  • save
 Save the current function key popup menu settings as the defaults and create/replace a custom main menu entry if needed for options that are typed if they don't exist in the popup menus.
  • reset
 Restore the original menu defaults. Does not affect the custom main menu entry (if one was created).
Return to the mainMain Menumain_menuMain Menu EntriesantiX-VERSION (DATE)
 Boot the system normally. You can use the Function key menus to select various options such as consoleConsole resolution, various optionsOptions, or persistPersistence. 

Safe Video Mode
 Disable KMS (kernel mode set) video drivers and force the use of the vesa video driver. Try this option of the system seems to boot but the screen is blank. 

Failsafe Boot
 In addition to forcing safe video, also load all drivers early in the boot process. Try this option if the system does not boot at all. 

Boot from Hard Drive
 This will attempt a legacy (BIOS) from the first internal hard drive. Windows 8 and above use UEFI instead of BIOS so this entry won't be able to boot them. 

Test Memory
 Test the system memory without booting into any operating system.
Return to the mainMain Menumain_optionsMain Menu Boot Options These are the options that show up in the Boot Options box. 
quiet Tell the kernel to not print a lot of debugging information to the screen.
splash=v Enable background decoration on the virtual (text) consoles. Delete it or set it to off to disable these decorations.
bo_antixdisable=lx Disable some startup services for faster booting and less RAM usage.
nomodeset Do not let the video driver take over the console. If the screen goes blank early in the boot process then you probably need this option.
xorg=safe Disable the hardware video driver from controlling graphics mode. Some drivers have trouble with older hardware.
failsafe Load all drivers early in the boot process and enable safe video mode. Use this if the live media fails to boot. To only load all drivers use load=all.
Return to the mainMain Menubo_instructBoot Option InstructionsThere are many boot options available. They are usually only necessary if your system will not boot properly. To use the boot options just place the appropriate code in the Boot Options box at the bottom of the main screen. You may also need to edit or delete options that are already in the Boot Options box.
You can't make permanent changes on a LiveCD or a LiveDVD. You have to enter them each time you boot. You can make permanent changes on some LiveUSBs.
Go to bo_antixantiX Boot Options

Back to bo_instructBoot Option Instructions
 Return to the mainMain Menubo_acpiACPIACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, acpi is switched on when boot detects a BIOS newer than the year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI:
  • pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • acpi=off -- turn off ACPI completely  • acpi=force -- turn on ACPI, for pre-2000 BIOS
Return to mm_bootBoot Options | mainMain Menubo_nonoXXXX Skips detection of or enables support for specific hardware. 
  • noauto -- turn off hardware autodetection  • noparallel -- turn off parallel printer support  • nopcmcia -- turn off PCMCIA support  • nousb -- turn off usb device probing  • nousebios -- enable NoUseBios mode needed for some Savage cards  • smouse -- enable only a serial mouse  • swcursor -- enable sw_cursor mode needed for some ATI and Trident cards
